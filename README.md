# binaryTree
Test to implement balanced and unbalanced Binary Search Tree

The purpose of this was toimplement a minmax search node on both balanced and unbalanced tree. 

Because the main tree is done as a balanced tree, if you force the unbalanced tree, the ``node.add()`` method will add a node in a balanced tree flavor.
